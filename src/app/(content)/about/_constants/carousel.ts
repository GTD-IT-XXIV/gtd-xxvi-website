  "Get Together Day (GTD) is a Freshmen Orientation Camp that is held every year to welcome Indonesian freshmen who will pursue their higher education at NTU. GTD is managed and run by students who voluntarily support the event.",
  "Through its 26 years of existence, GTD has been fulfilling its mission to familiarise freshmen with Singapore and to integrate them with the Indonesian community in NTU.",
  "As an orientation camp, GTD is usually held a week before the school term starts. The event lasts for 4 days and is conducted fully offline while still adhering local regulation. Throughout GTD, participants will play games that brings a lively and welcoming atmosphere among themselves and their peers.",
  "Unlike most stereotypical examples of Indonesian orientation (seniority and hazing activities or perploncoan), GTD is designed and specially planned for freshmen to bond with their fellow freshies and seniors. The orientation group (also known as OG) will be your first family in Singapore, before you get to know your course mates. With the exciting games made by the committee, freshmen will get the chance to mingle with their Indonesian cohorts in NTU and to have great fun, all at the same time.",
